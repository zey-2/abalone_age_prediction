# **Module 3 Coaching session-1: Abalone Age Prediction**

Today, you'll be working with a dataset to predict the age of abalone, a type of sea snail. This exercise will give you hands-on experience with regression modeling using two popular techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression.

You will have approximately **two hours** to complete this assessment. 

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

* Download and load the Abalone dataset.  
* Perform basic exploratory data analysis.  
* Preprocess categorical features for regression modeling.  
* Build and train a linear regression model.  
* Evaluate the performance of your models using a suitable metric.  
* Understand the basic principles of KNN and or linear regression.

## **Dataset: Abalone**

We will be using the Abalone dataset, which contains physical measurements of abalone and their corresponding number of rings. The number of rings can be used to estimate the age of the abalone (Age \= Rings \+ 1.5). The dataset includes the following features :

* **Sex:** M (Male), F (Female), I (Infant)  
* **Length:** Longest shell measurement (mm)  
* **Diameter:** Perpendicular to length (mm)  
* **Height:** With meat in shell (mm)  
* **Whole weight:** Whole abalone (grams)  
* **Shucked weight:** Weight of meat (grams)  
* **Viscera weight:** Gut weight after bleeding (grams)  
* **Shell weight:** After being dried (grams)  
* **Rings:** Number of rings (our target variable)

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Download the Dataset:**

   * You can download the Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Go to this link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone)  
   * Look for the "Data Folder" and download the abalone.data file.  
2. **Load the Dataset:**

   * Use a programming language like Python with libraries such as Pandas to load the downloaded data into a DataFrame.  
   * If you downloaded abalone.data, the file does not contain headers. You will need to provide the column names as listed above (including 'Rings').  
3. **Explore the Data (Briefly):**

   * Get a feel for the data by looking at the first few rows, checking the data types, and getting some basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).  
4. **Preprocess the Data:**

   * Notice that the 'Sex' feature is categorical (M, F, I). Both KNN and basic linear regression work best with numerical data. You will need to convert this categorical feature into a numerical representation. Consider using techniques like one-hot encoding.  
5. **Prepare Features and Target:**

   * Identify the 'Rings' column as your target variable (the one you want to predict).  
   * The remaining columns (after encoding 'Sex') will be your features.  
6. **Split the Data:**

   * Divide your dataset into training and testing sets. This will allow you to train your models on one part of the data and evaluate their performance on unseen data. A common split is 70-80% for training and the rest for testing.  
7. **Build and Train the KNN Regression Model:**

   * Use a library like scikit-learn in Python to implement the KNN regression model.  
   * Choose a value for 'k' (the number of neighbors to consider). You can start with a small value like 3 or 5\.  
   * Train the model using your training data.  
8. **Build and Train the Linear Regression Model:**

   * Use the same library (scikit-learn) to implement a linear regression model.  
   * Train the model using your training data.  
9. **Evaluate the Models:**

   * Use your testing data to make predictions with both the KNN and linear regression models.  
   * Evaluate the performance of each model using a suitable regression metric. A common metric is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The lower the RMSE, the better the model's performance. You can also consider using R-squared.

## **Guidelines and Expectations**

* **Time Management:** Please be mindful of time limit. Focus on completing the core steps of downloading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating.  
* **Simplicity is Key:** For this introductory session, you don't need to aim for the highest possible accuracy. The focus is on understanding the process and applying the techniques.  
* **Brief Notes:** Keep track of your findings, such as the RMSE values you obtain for both models.  
* **Presentation:** At the end of the session, we will have a 10-minute wrap-up. One student will be randomly selected to briefly present their work (the steps they followed, the models they built, and the results they obtained).

## **Bonus (Optional)**

If you have extra time, you can explore:

* Trying different values of 'k' for the KNN model.  
* Scaling the numerical features before training the models.  
* Investigating the correlations between different features in the dataset.
